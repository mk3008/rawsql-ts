# Spec-Change Scenarios (Quick Reference)

Condensed scenarios covering common specification and schema changes, what steps were needed, and the key takeaway for each.

## 1. Add a NOT NULL column

**What changed:** A new `NOT NULL` column added to an existing table's DDL.

**Steps:** `ztd ztd-config` → fix compile errors in fixtures (must include the new column) → update `rowMapping` column maps if needed → re-run tests.

**Takeaway:** NOT NULL columns force fixture updates everywhere the table appears. Plan fixture changes before adding the column.

## 2. Rename a column

**What changed:** Column renamed in DDL (e.g., `name` → `display_name`).

**Steps:** `ztd ztd-config` → update SQL files, `rowMapping.columnMap`, validator schemas, and fixtures → re-run tests.

**Takeaway:** TypeScript compile errors are your guide — the generated `TestRowMap` reflects the new name immediately. Fix all references before running tests.

## 3. Change a column type

**What changed:** Column type changed (e.g., `integer` → `bigint`, `text` → `jsonb`).

**Steps:** `ztd ztd-config` → update runtime coercions if driver behavior differs (e.g., bigint returns strings) → update validator schemas → re-run tests.

**Takeaway:** Type changes often require runtime coercion updates. Check the [Postgres pitfalls](./postgres-pitfalls.md) page for driver-specific quirks.

## 4. Add a new table

**What changed:** New CREATE TABLE added to DDL.

**Steps:** `ztd ztd-config` → new type appears in `TestRowMap` → write SQL queries, fixtures, and tests → run tests.

**Takeaway:** The simplest scenario — no existing code is affected. Generated types are immediately available.

## 5. Drop a table

**What changed:** Table removed from DDL.

**Steps:** `ztd ztd-config` → type disappears from `TestRowMap` → compile errors show all affected code → remove SQL files, repository methods, fixtures, and tests.

**Takeaway:** Compile errors are exhaustive. Fix them all and you're done.

## 6. Add a foreign key or index

**What changed:** Constraint or index added to DDL.

**Steps:** `ztd ztd-config` → no type-level changes (indexes/FKs don't affect `TestRowMap`) → test behavior is unchanged.

**Takeaway:** ZTD doesn't enforce FK constraints in test fixtures — it operates on data, not schema constraints. Runtime tests against a live DB will enforce them.

## 7. Change the default schema or search path

**What changed:** `ddl.defaultSchema` or `ddl.searchPath` updated in `ztd.config.json`.

**Steps:** `ztd ztd-config --default-schema <name> --search-path <list>` → regenerate types → SQL files may need schema-qualified names → re-run tests.

**Takeaway:** Schema resolution is a common source of "table not found" errors. Always keep `ztd.config.json` in sync with the database's `search_path`.

## 8. Validator schema drift after DDL change

**What changed:** DDL changed but the Zod/ArkType schema was not updated.

**Steps:** Tests pass (validator still matches old shape) → runtime fails on real data → update validator schema to match new `TestRowMap` shape → re-run tests.

**Takeaway:** Validators are not auto-generated — they must be manually kept in sync with the mapped DTO. Run `ztd check-contract` to catch drift early.

## 9. Add/remove a column used in rowMapping

**What changed:** Column referenced in `rowMapping.columnMap` was removed or renamed in DDL.

**Steps:** `ztd ztd-config` → `rowMapping` references a column that no longer exists → runtime mapping error → update `columnMap` → re-run tests.

**Takeaway:** `rowMapping` column maps are not type-checked against DDL. Use `ztd lint` to catch column mismatches early.

## 10. Switch validator backend (Zod ↔ ArkType)

**What changed:** Project migrated from one validator to another.

**Steps:** Update spec files in `src/catalog/specs/` → update runtime files → update `package.json` dependencies → re-run tests.

**Takeaway:** Validator-agnostic design means the switch is limited to spec/runtime files. The SQL layer and `rowMapping` are unaffected.
