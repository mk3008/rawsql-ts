'@rawsql-ts/ztd-cli': patch
---

- ztd init now writes the tests/AGENTS.md guidance next to the generated tests layout so the CLI includes the latest testing rules without manual steps.
- Expanded the AGENTS templates to spell out the required validation and testing expectations for general and tests directories.
