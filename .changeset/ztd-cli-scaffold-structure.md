Add the new default ZTD scaffold layout with view SQL under "src/sql/views", job SQL under "src/sql/jobs", and repositories split between "src/repositories/views" and "src/repositories/tables". The init command now supports "--yes" to overwrite existing scaffold files without prompts for non-interactive runs.
