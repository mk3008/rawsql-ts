You are working in a generated ZTD playground.

Implement a minimal CRUD-oriented sample based only on local project files and AGENTS.md in this playground.

Constraints:
- Do not reference any files outside this workspace.
- Do not configure Codex with additional directories.
- Keep SQL and repository/catalog changes minimal and testable.

Deliverables:
- Add or update SQL under `src/sql`.
- Add or update matching catalog/runtime/repository code if needed.
- Ensure `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm test` pass.

Output policy:
- Make concrete file edits directly in this workspace.
- Keep changes small and deterministic.
