# Package Scope
- Applies to `benchmarks/sql-unit-test`.
- Defines benchmark execution contract for unit-test performance measurement artifacts.

# Policy
## REQUIRED
- Benchmark reports under this subtree MUST be generated by executable benchmark scripts.
- Benchmark scripts MUST execute the same code paths used by Vitest test suites.
- Benchmark interpretation changes MUST be implemented in benchmark scripts.

## ALLOWED
- Benchmark scripts MAY adjust measured scope, parameters, or report schema.

## PROHIBITED
- Manually editing generated benchmark reports.
- Reimplementing benchmark-only logic that bypasses existing test paths.

# Mandatory Workflow
- When benchmark behavior or output changes, benchmark scripts MUST be re-run before commit.

# Hygiene
- Generated report edits MUST come only from script execution output.

# References
- Parent benchmark policy context: [../../AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)
