# DDL Definitions

This folder stores table structure definitions (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, indexes, constraints) under `sql/ddl/<schema>.sql`.
ZTD treats the SQL files here as the single source of truth for schemas.

AI and humans must reference this directory when modifying or understanding table structures.
