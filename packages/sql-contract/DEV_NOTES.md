# SQL Contract Dev Notes

## Commands
- `pnpm --filter @rawsql-ts/sql-contract lint`
- `pnpm --filter @rawsql-ts/sql-contract test`
- `pnpm --filter @rawsql-ts/sql-contract build`

## Troubleshooting
- Keep mapper tests data-oriented and explicit.
- Keep writer tests focused on SQL string and params behavior.
