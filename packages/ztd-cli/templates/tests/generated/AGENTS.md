# tests/generated AGENTS

This directory contains generated files.

## Non-negotiable

- Do not edit any file in this directory by hand.
- Do not commit generated artifacts unless the repository explicitly requires it.

## Regeneration

If files are missing or stale, regenerate using the project command.
Example:
- "npx ztd ztd-config"

If TypeScript reports missing modules referencing generated files, regenerate first.
